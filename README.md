##**Objective**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Currently, the company is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The goal of this project is to answer any relevant business questions on the part of the Rockbuster Stealth Management team that would affect the launch of this new business line as part of the 2020 company strategy. The data analyzed in this project includes, among other things: customer profiles, film characteristics, and transaction data. The main questions theyâ€™d like to answer are:

          - Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
          - What was the average rental duration for all videos?
          - Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
          - Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
          - Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

##**Data**

A relational database made up of 16 connected tables containing data on film rentals, customer, actors, payments, film characteristics, store characteristics, and more. 
The original source data is available [here] (http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).

##**Result**
Based on the nations with the most customers, Rockbuster was recommended to acquire titles in Spanish, Russina, Chinese Mandarin & Cantonese, Japanese, Tagalog, and Portugues languages. The types of film in Rockbuster's library should be adjusted to reflected a greater number of Sci-Fi, Animation, Drama, and Comedy offerings as those were top revenue-generating genres that were under-represented in the library. Lastly, special marketing efforts should be made toward entering the Australian market due to the relative affluence and English-speaking status of the clientele there, requiring little adjustment of Rockbuster's existing library.
